Airsoft photogate chronograph

<p>Sometimes, you need a tool that performs well. Sometimes, you need a tool that is cheap. I did not, truly, <i>need</i> this tool, but there is something to be said for trying to build something just to see if you can. This is that.</p>
<p>An airsoft chronograph is a tool for determining the muzzle velocity (and, more importantly, mozzule energy) of an airsoft gun, or any other projectile device. These are a necessity for anyone who modifies or experiments with airsoft guns with hopes to actually use them in a game, since most airsoft fields restrict muzzle velocity to 375 feet per second. A story-bought chronograph typically costs north of a hundred dollars. For what I believed could be accomplished with a pair of photogates and a microcontroller, this seemed too expensive.</p>
<p>So, of course, I set about building one from scratch</p>
<p>For a start, I investigated various means of constructing a photogate.</p>
<p>A photogate consists of an emitter and a detector. The emitter is left on, and pointed at the detector. When the path between the two is obstructed, the electrical characteristics of the detector change. In an acceptable configuration, these changes are immediate, consistently timed, and need to be triggered in under the amount of time that it takes for the projectile to pass through the beam of light. With an airsoft pellet passing by a 6mm LED at somewhere shy of 500 fps, this is a tight timing window; the pellet obstructs the beam for about 40 microseconds, depending on how much obstruction it takes to trigger the sensor.</p>
<p>The options that became apparent were photocells and photodiodes. Through the magic of Ebay, a handful of photocells and photodiodes were acquired. The photodiodes were Siemens SFH309-FA5s. The photocells were generic cadmium photocells of no specifications. Also purchased were a few (100) infrared LEDs. Bench tests found that photocells were entirely ineffective for anything moving quicker than a waggling finger. Photodiodes, however, had no such trouble, given a well-tuned current-to-voltage detector (voltage divider where one leg is the sensor)</p>
