<!--POSTSLICES--><h1>Airsoft photogate chronograph</h1><p>Sometimes, you need a tool that performs well. Sometimes, you need a tool that is cheap. I did not, truly, <i>need</i> this tool, but there is something to be said for trying to build something just to see if you can. This is that.</p><p>An airsoft chronograph is a tool for determining the muzzle velocity (and, more importantly, muzzle energy) of an airsoft gun, or any other projectile device. These are a necessity for anyone who modifies or experiments with airsoft guns with hopes to actually use them in a game, since most airsoft fields restrict muzzle velocity to 375 feet per second. A store-bought chronograph typically costs north of a hundred dollars. For what I believed could be accomplished with a pair of photogates and a microcontroller, this seemed too expensive.</p><p>So, of course, I set about building one from scratch.</p><img src="../photos/chronograph/overview.JPG" width=100% /><p>For a start, I investigated various means of constructing a photogate.</p><p>A photogate consists of an emitter and a detector. The emitter is left on, and pointed at the detector. When the path between the two is obstructed, the electrical characteristics of the detector change. In an acceptable configuration, these changes are immediate, consistently timed, and need to be triggered in under the amount of time that it takes for the projectile to pass through the beam of light. With an airsoft pellet passing by a 6mm LED at somewhere shy of 500 fps, this is a tight timing window; the pellet obstructs the beam for about 40 microseconds, depending on how much obstruction it takes to trigger the sensor.</p><p>The options that became apparent were photocells and photodiodes. Through the magic of Ebay, a handful of photocells and photodiodes were acquired. The photodiodes were Siemens SFH309-FA5s. The photocells were generic cadmium photocells of no specifications. Also purchased were a few (100) infrared LEDs. Bench tests found that photocells were entirely ineffective for anything moving quicker than a waggling finger. Photodiodes, however, had no such trouble, given a well-tuned current-to-voltage detector (voltage divider where one leg is the sensor). Combined with a strong LED, these diodes could reliable trigger a pin-change interrupt on an ATMega</p><br><p>With my parts in hand, I drew a circuit diagram (not included here for having been thrown out a while ago) and soldered it together for a minimal prototype. There was duct tape and zip ties involved.</p><p>Photos of this stage of the project are not available, since it was, at this stage, hideous. Also, the photos were lost in the churn of my phone dying a slow and painful death.</p><p>Once it had been found to work, a design consisting of more than duct tape and some scrap pine was needed. The electronics were soldered together on a permanent Arduino shield.</p><p>With all parts soldered together and screen attached. measurements were taken and a design made in AutoCad, and the Centrepointe <i>Imagine Space</i> laser cutter was used to create the sheets from 6 and 3 mm MDF.</p><img src="../photos/chronograph/closeup.JPG" width=50% /><img src="../photos/chronograph/guts.JPG" width=50% /><br><p>The software running on the microncontroller was fairly simple, and can be found <a href="https://github.com/choltfo/Chronograph/blob/master/Chronograph.ino">on my GitHub</a>. It works by attaching a falling-edge external interrupt to the pins associated with each photogate, and measuring the time between these two gates being triggered. The system loops over updating the screen.</p>

<p>Hey, since you seem interested: If you want a mechatronics engineering co-op student for fall 2017, here's my <a href="../CharlesHoltforster.pdf">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.</p>
<p>If that's how you got here in the first place, then I hope this story has done something to sway your hiring opinions in my favour!</p>
