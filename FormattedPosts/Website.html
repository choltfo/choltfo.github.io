<!--POSTSLICES--><h1>How to make a website the strange way</h1><p>Once upon a time, there was a guy who built stuff. He got into engineering school, and continued making cool things. But then, disaster struck: He had failed to document the cool things, so all his friends were getting the cool jobs that he wanted. Something had to be done.</p><p>And so, this website was born. GitHub pages was chosen as a host on the recommendation of a friend. Included in GitHub Pages is Jekyll, which allows for generation of blogs from markdown documents. It is a quick, easy, painless method for generating static pages and putting them on a website.</p><p>But where's the fun in that?</p><p>Indeed, opportunities to do things the entertaining way are the roots of almost all of my projects (Surely I can build a cheap <a href="chronograph.html">chronograph</a>!). "How hard can it be?" is the mother of re-invention.</p><p>What I needed was a piece of software that could sandwhich together pieces of content between headers and footers, and populate an index with their titles and preambles. Jekyll is capable of far more than just this, but I do not need far more than this. I chose to roll my own. So, I turned towards the many languages available. Python was the clear choice, with Java a close second.</p><p>So, needless to say, I went with the favorite of sysadmins and codegolfers everywhere: Windows PowerShell.</p><p>Why, you might ask? Simply, why not? It's a good scripting language with weak typing. Nowhere in a PowerShell manual will you see "explicit is better than implicit", so the scripts are short. Also, ever since my job doing load testing at Halogen, I've loved this language. It's fun to write, it's easy to work with, and it gets things done. It's pretty much Perl-lite (Which would also have been a good language to use here...) with a healthy helping of C# and Bash. There are pipes, but they're object oriented, but they're weakly typed.</p><p>If nothing else, it's an entertaining language, it isn't Python, and watching some of my programmer buddies squirm when I bring it up makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
