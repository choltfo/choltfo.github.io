<!--POSTSLICES--><h1>Building a Coilgun: Round 5</h1><p>As <i>Cage The Elephant</i> said, there ain't no rest for the wicked.</p><p>I had been working on a new coilgun design on my spare time from about January 2020 onwards. Time passed, nations plunged into dissarray, and I wound up working at Hacksmith again for my final co-op.</p><p>Spoiler: The new version keeps catching fire. I'm working on it.</p><br/><p>Apparently, I was running my mouth about this cool new project a bit too much, since I was asked by Ian to prepare a budget for construcing this device as a work project.</p><p>With the warning that I was out on a fishing trip for one of the four remaining weeks of the term, I agreed to get the thing built.</p><p>So, it should come as no surprise that, then, <a href="Documents/Coilgun_2020_08_Holtforster.pdf">I wrote a report on this one too.</a></p><h3>The mission:</h3><p>The only real constraint on the project was the same as round 4: Don't get arrested for building it. As for performance constraints, I had a few things:</p><ul>	<li>Muzle velocity &gt;100m/s</li>	<li>Fire rate &gt;10Hz</li>	<li>Muzzle energy &gt;50J</li></ul><p>On top of that, I decided that the gun had to be</p><ul>	<li>Lighter</li>	<li>Smaller</li>	<li>More comfortable</li>	<li>Easier to assemble</li>	<li>Prettier</li></ul><p>than the last one (HackSmith CoilGun M.2020, or HSCG20).</p><p>I also wanted to keep to battery operation, rather than using capacitors for energy storage<a id="lft1"/><a href="#ft1">[1]</a></sup>. The performance seen on HSCG20 did not suggest that batteries were a problem, and better batteries were available.<!--- need sketch photos ---><br/><h3>How do we do we want to do this?</h3><p> I started the design on my own budget and time. So, clearly, I wanted to design this thing to have the cheapest super high power supply that I could get my hands on. I looked about, and found that Turnigy had relased a new series of battery that lays claim to an incredible <!--- VALUE ---> amps! Three of these 4S packs could provide, according to their manufacturer's claims, 77,000W. That ought to be plenty.</p><p></p><!---<a id="lft4"/><a href="#ft4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>---><!---<a id="ft1"/><p><a href="#lft1">[1]</a>asdfasdfasdfasdf </p>---><h3>Footnotes:</h3><a id="ft1"/><p><a href="#lft1">[1]</a>: Since getting most of the design work dealt with, I've been thinking about other ways to drive a railgun or coilgun. My current favourite idea is a hydraulically or pneumatically accelerated flywheel on an alternator. Could allow for some very interesting sounding arrangements - we don't need boost converter whine, we've got a die grinder! That, and the power density on, say, a truck starter motor is pretty darn good.</p>
