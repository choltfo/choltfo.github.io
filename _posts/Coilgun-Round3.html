Building a Coilgun: Round 3

PostIndex:7
<p>I happen to have acquired four 1000-foot rolls of 18AWG automotive wiring.</p>
<p>What else was I supposed to do?</p>
<h3>It's coilgun time. Round 3. Fight.</h3>
<p>Small problem with the plan: Capacitors suck.</p>
<p>The capacitors that I have on hand are of unknown provenance and dubious origin. They are also of unknown DC ESR, and equally confusing ESL.</p>
<p>Building a coilgun with 18AWG wire poses a challenge. Since it is automotive wiring, not magnet wire, you lose a lot of coil packing efficiency. Which means that you need current where you would otherwise be able to get away with more turns of copper. However, because of the girth of the wire in question, you can't just keep adding wire without reaching diminishing returns. So, instead, you need more current.</p>
<p>RLC discharge curves ruin everything. With 10 of the capacitors on hand in an array for each stage, assuming 170 windings on a 35mm, 10mm-ID spool, the current pulse would have time to peak and peter out in the course of a 14 ms firing pulse.</p>
<p>This would save a lot of hassle with flyback suppression, as none would be needed, but at the cost of significantly lowering the power.<p>
<br/>
<p>Lithium ion batteries are cheap, readily acquired, and capable of some truly amazing things if treated right. More importantly, high performance batteries are effectively ideal voltage sources. The batteries in use on my <a href="/pub/Tank-Part4.html">RC car project</a> can output 200A at 24V for a period of ten seconds while remaining within operating specifications.</p>
<p>200A is, applied correctly, enough juice to get a steel armature moving pretty darn quick, pretty darn quickly. It's the "24V" part that could be a problem....</p>
<p>LiPO batteries are categorized (generally) by the number of cells in series that they are composed of. This value ranges from one to six, and are laballed as "1S" through "6S". 6S is the largest LiPO battery size that is readily bought. It operates at approximately 24 volts, ish, nominally. Two of these packs in series, then, would provide a magnificent 48V DC, with an ESR measured in single-digit milliohms.</p>
<p>With a correctly designed coil, that could make things happen. Hole-in-ceiling things.</p>
<p>The Waterloo Engineering 3D print centre just so happens to have a promotion running whereby one can get a free custom milled PCB every two weeks.</p>
