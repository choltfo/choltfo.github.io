<!--POSTSLICES--><h3><a href="FormattedPosts/Chronograph.html">Airsoft photogate chronograph</a></h3><hr><img src="/photos/chronograph/overview.JPG" width=50% /><p>Sometimes, you need a tool that performs as well as possible. This is not that. Sometimes, you need a tool that is cheap. This is not that. I did not, truly, <i>need</i> this tool, but there is something to be said for trying to build something just to see if you can. <i>This</i> is that.</p><p>An airsoft chronograph is a tool for determining the muzzle velocity (and, more importantly, muzzle energy) of an airsoft gun, or any other projectile device. These are a necessity for anyone who modifies or experiments with airsoft guns with hopes to actually use them in a game, since most airsoft fields restrict muzzle velocity to a certain number (typically, between 375 and 425 feet per second). A store-bought chronograph typically costs north of a hundred dollars. For what I believed could be accomplished with a pair of photogates and a microcontroller, this seemed too expensive.</p><p>So, of course, I set about building one from scratch.</p><p><a href="FormattedPosts/Chronograph.html">Continue reading</a></p><br><h3><a href="FormattedPosts/Website.html">How to make a website the strange way</a></h3><hr><p>Once upon a time, there was a guy who built stuff. He got into engineering school, and continued making cool things. But then, disaster struck: He had failed to document the cool things, so all his friends were getting the cool jobs that he wanted. Something had to be done.</p><p>And so, this website was born. GitHub pages was chosen as a host on the recommendation of a friend. Included in GitHub Pages is Jekyll, which allows for generation of blogs from markdown documents. It is a quick, easy, painless method for generating static pages and putting them on a website.</p><p>But where's the fun in that?</p><p><a href="FormattedPosts/Website.html">Continue reading</a></p><br>
