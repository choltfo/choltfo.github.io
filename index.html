<!--POSTSLICES--><h3><a href="FormattedPosts/Chronograph.html">Airsoft photogate chronograph</a></h3><hr><img src="/photos/chronograph/overview.JPG" width=50% /><p>Sometimes, you need a tool that performs well. Sometimes, you need a tool that is cheap. I did not, truly, <i>need</i> this tool, but there is something to be said for trying to build something just to see if you can. This is that.</p><p>An airsoft chronograph is a tool for determining the muzzle velocity (and, more importantly, mozzule energy) of an airsoft gun, or any other projectile device. These are a necessity for anyone who modifies or experiments with airsoft guns with hopes to actually use them in a game, since most airsoft fields restrict muzzle velocity to 375 feet per second. A story-bought chronograph typically costs north of a hundred dollars. For what I believed could be accomplished with a pair of photogates and a microcontroller, this seemed too expensive.</p><p>So, of course, I set about building one from scratch</p><br><h3><a href="FormattedPosts/Post1.html">Post 1</a></h3><hr><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sn5W4Va.jpg" width=50% /><p>Once upon a time, there was a guy who built stuff. He got into engineering school, and continued making cool things. But then, disaster struck: He had failed to document the cool things, so all his friends were getting the cool jobs that he wanted. Something had to be done.</p><p>And so, this website was born.</p><br><h3><a href="FormattedPosts/Post2.html">Post 2</a></h3><hr><p>This, too, is a test...</p><p>an awesome one...</p><br>
